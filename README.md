# Project-1

## Description

Our website is all about food and drink, the cornerstones of literally any civilization. Imagine a world without drinks ouch. 
We started out as a website just about drinks. Originally we planned to make something that would showcase any specific drink and accompany that drink with a video on how to make it. However we later decided to expand into a food website as they would go together absolutely perfectly. Just a few clicks and words will give you plentiful information about your choice or food and drink.

However, if you happen to be an indecisive person, not to worry. We have a random button that will give you a random drink and a dish from a library of thousands of different kinds from the web api we used.
