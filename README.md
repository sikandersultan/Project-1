## User story

As an extremly busy student that is also working part-time to afford my living expense, I find myself having no time to go through the millions of different food and drinks website. So I go to one website where all my food and drink ideas can be broken down to simple easy to read ingredients with specific measurements as well as concise instructions. Additionlly if the student isnt too sure what to have any given afternoon, this website can give him a random choice of food and drink as many times as the student pleases.

## Description

Our website is all about food and drink, the cornerstones of literally any civilization. Imagine a world without drinks ouch.
We started out as a website just about drinks. Originally we planned to make something that would showcase any specific drink and accompany that drink with a video on how to make it. However we later decided to expand into a food website as they would go together absolutely perfectly. Just a few clicks and words will give you plentiful information about your choice or food and drink.

However, if you happen to be an indecisive person, not to worry. We have a random button that will give you a random drink and a dish from a library of thousands of different kinds from the web api we used.
